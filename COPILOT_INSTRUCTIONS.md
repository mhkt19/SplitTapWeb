# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for SplitTapWeb

- This website is a complementary application for the SplitTap mobile app.
- The UI and underlying code should closely follow the patterns and structure of the mobile version wherever possible.
- Since most users will access the site from mobile devices (especially Apple devices), always prioritize a mobile-friendly, responsive design and sizing in all UI and UX decisions.
- Match the look, feel, and logic of the Android/iOS app as much as possible.
